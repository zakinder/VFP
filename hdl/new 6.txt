This module receives video data in YCbCr 4:4:4 format with 8 bits per component and configured into axi stream YCbCr 4:2:2 format.


Video data in YCbCr 4:2:2 format and associated synchronization signals 
are input into the Video Data Capture block from the Video Input 
Daughtercard.






The ADV7611 receivers and ADV7511 transmitters used in this design are configured for YCbCr 
4:2:2 color format with 8 bits per component. This results in a video data interface width of 16 
bits per clock cycle (8 bits for the luma component and 8 bits for the interleaved chroma red 
and blue difference components). 


The maximum theoretical video memory bandwidth (per stream) is calculated as follows:
Bandwidth (per stream) = max_frame_rate × max_active_lines_per_frame × 
max_active_pixels_per_line × bits_per_pixel (b/s).





Because this design supports up to UXGA resolution (1600 x 1200) at 60 frames per second, 
max_frame_rate is 60, max_active_lines_per_frame is 1600, and max_active_pixels_per_line is 
1200. The design also supports only the YCbCr 4:2:2 color format with 8 bits per component, 
giving 16 bits per pixel. Using the above equation, the final bandwidth requirement calculation 
for this design is:
Bandwidth (per stream) = 60 × 1600 × 1200 × 16 = 1,843,200,000 = 1.8432 (Gb/s)
The design uses a total of 4 streams (two AXI VDMA instances, each configured for both read 
and write) so the total aggregate memory bandwidth requirement is:
Bandwidth (total) = 1.8432 × 4 = 7.3728 (Gb/s)
Each of the AXI VDMA's memory mapped interfaces must be configured to support at least the 
required bandwidth per stream. They are configured to be 64 bits wide and run at a rate of 
200MHz. This gives a maximum theoretical supported bandwidth of 64 × 200 = 12,800 (Mb/s) 
= 12.8 (Gb/s).


The reference design implements four video pipelines running at 1080P60 (1920 x 1080 
pictures at 60 frames/sec). Each frame consists of three bytes per pixel to represent an 
upper-bound, high-quality video stream such as RGB with alpha channel information. Each 
video pipeline requires a bandwidth of 373.248 MB/s, which is approximately 3 Gb/s.
